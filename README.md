# phpQueries
Easy function to call receiving data from a database. I have provided example files to show how to call the functions!

This function has been created to save time as it doesn't require the user to write multiple database connections. It also keeps front-end code neat and tidy meaning it will be easier to maintain!


1. The constants.php file shows database connection examples
2. databaseConnect.php contains the class and functions to read from the database
3. exampleUsage.php contains the class and function which uses databaseConnect to connect to the database (example use!)
4. displayMessages.php displays the function from exampleUsage.php displaying messages from the database

These files can be manipulated to create any database reads.
